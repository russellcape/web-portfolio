            <p>Junior web developer with a background in commerce, engineering and entrepreneurship. As an ambitious and detail-oriented person, I am passionate about creating a great user experience while developing clean, efficient code. My entrepreneurial experience has taught me the importance of customer satisfaction, as well as, management of employees and equipment with a budget in mind. I am eager to learn on the frontlines, where I can benefit from the environment around me. Currently, in my free time, I am taking online cybersecurity classes on Cybrary, as well as, taking hands-on courses by Creation Crate to learn C++ and making a portfolio website using React. I have completed certifications in both Cybersecurity and Information Technologies basics and, currently, I am working on a System Administration Certification from Cybrary.</p>
